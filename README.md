This library is designed to generate highly functional HTML pages using HTML CSS and JS without requiring the programmer to know any of those.

This library is going still in development, but to get started ->
  For each kind of object there is a NewObject_Name() function that will generate a new of that object.
  page.go generates a new page that will have a head and a body.
  All the objects in /body can be added to page
  All the objects in /element can be added to the object in body
  
  Various JS module which are still being made are in /js and can be added to the page.
  THere will be several functions in CSS that will be able to work on both body type objects
  and element type objects to change the style.
  
 THis library is not even half-done. There is a LOT more functionality I will be adding and refining as time goes on.
